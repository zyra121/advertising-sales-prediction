## Introduction

In this project, we explore how advertising influences sales using linear regression. By analyzing the relationship between advertising spend and sales, we can make predictions and better understand market dynamics. This project is ideal for beginners looking to learn about data science and machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on advertising budgets across different media channels (TV, radio, and newspaper) and their corresponding sales figures. The dataset is structured with the following columns:

- **TV**: Advertising budget spent on TV
- **Radio**: Advertising budget spent on radio
- **Newspaper**: Advertising budget spent on newspapers
- **Sales**: Sales figures generated

This dataset is widely used in data science courses and is an excellent starting point for learning linear regression.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zyra121/advertising-sales-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd advertising-sales-prediction
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   This project uses Python, along with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. You can install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once you have the project set up, you can start exploring the dataset and running the linear regression model. Here are some commands to help you get started:

1. **Load the dataset:**

   Use Pandas to load the dataset:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   data = pd.read_csv('advertising.csv')
   ```

2. **Run the linear regression model:**

   Use Scikit-learn to create and fit the model:

   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

   X = data[['TV', 'Radio', 'Newspaper']]
   y = data['Sales']

   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

3. **Make predictions:**

   You can make predictions using the trained model:

   ```python
   predictions = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

4. **Evaluate the model:**

   Assess the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or R-squared:

   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score

   print('Mean Absolute Error:', mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions))
   print('R-squared:', r2_score(y_test, predictions))
   ```

## Features

This project includes several features to help you understand linear regression:

- **Data Cleaning**: Functions to clean and preprocess the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations to understand the relationships between variables.
- **Model Training**: Steps to train and evaluate the linear regression model.
- **Visualizations**: Graphs to illustrate the model's predictions against actual sales.

## Visualization

Visualizing data is crucial for understanding patterns and relationships. This project uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective visualizations. Here are some examples:

1. **Scatter Plot**: Show the relationship between advertising spend and sales.

   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns

   sns.scatterplot(x='TV', y='Sales', data=data)
   plt.title('TV Advertising vs Sales')
   plt.show()
   ```

2. **Correlation Heatmap**: Display the correlation between different features.

   ```python
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
   plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
   plt.show()
   ```

These visualizations can help you interpret the data and understand the effectiveness of different advertising channels.
